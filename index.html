Hello! My name is <b>Federico</b> and I am an Italian <b>Senior Machine Learning Engineer</b> working across <i>Machine Learning</i>, <i>Computer Vision</i> and <i>Robotics</i>. 
<br>
As a kid I was alternating between unscrewing everything that had electronics in it and building anything that could move with <i>Legos</i>.

<br>
Then one day, my dad taught me how to use a battery to power up small bulbs and motors, and in that moment the engineer in me was born.
<br>
My passion for robotics came shortly after when I saw <i>Cybot</i> on TV during an ad for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Robots">Real Robots</a> magazine. Unfortunately, my parents never allowed me to purchase a single number of it. But this pushed me to hand-solder my first PIC programmer to build a very simple robot based on micro switches. 
<br>
From there, one thing led to another and this has become my career. I have changed a lot, but the curiosity in me never did and it still fuels me to learn something new everyday.
<br><br>
When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I might be in front of a microphone instead, singing and playing my guitar.
<br>
I also enjoy spending time outdoors in nature, for example hiking in the Italian Dolomites or Colli Euganei. But I like spending my fair share of time chilling on the beach while the sun sets as well.
